### Running Guide
> run tunnel.argos and cell_lattic.bzz for 10 robots traveling through the tunnel keeping a cell shaped formation using light and proximity sensor while changing the adpative signals to expand and shrink the group size. 

> run tunnel.argos and cell_lattic2.bzz for 10 robots traveling through the tunnel keeping a cell shaped formation using light and proximity sensor with fixed signals. 

tunnel1-tunnel6.argos are experiments with varies tunnels and obstacles. 
analysis.m and plot.py are used to create plots for analysis
We also attached the plots and end results of the trails we run.
